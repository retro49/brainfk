THE BRAINF*CK INTERPRETER
--
A simple easy to use interpreter for simulating
the brainf*ck esotric programming language first
created by  Urban MÃ¼ller.

To get started it can be easily used in REPL
where a brainf*ck program can be easily typed in
and evaluated on the fly.

Otherwise this program can be used by providing different
arguments in order to run a program from a file and
check the memory layout.
